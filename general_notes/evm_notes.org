* EVM -> Ethereum Virtual Machine
** From ledger to state machine

*** State
enormous data structure -> modified merkle patricia trie

*** Transaction
1. result in a message call
2. result in contract creation

** EVM Instructions
+ EVM executes a stack machine with a depth of 1024 items.
+ each item: 256bit
+ There is a transient linear memory for each contract
+ Contracts contains also a merke Patricia Storage related to the account that is part of the global state
+ Compiled contract -> bytecode -> made by *opcode*
  + stack machine standard opcodes + blockchain related instrucitons
