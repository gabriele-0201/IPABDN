`RISC-V (pronounced “risk-five”) is a new instruction-set architecture (ISA)`

*** Introduction

`goals in
defining RISC-V include`
+ `completely open ISA`
+ `real ISA suitable for direct native hardware implementation`
+ `avoids “over-architecting”`
+ `ISA separated into a small base integer ISA, usable by itself`
+ `32-bit and 64-bit address space`
+ ...

**** RISC-V ISA Overview
`A RISC-V ISA is defined as a base integer ISA, which must be present in any implementation, plus optional extensions to the base ISA`

Currently there are 4 main base ISAs
`Each base integer instruction set is characterized by the width of the integer registers and the corresponding size of the address space and by the number of integer registers`

+ RV32I and RV64I provide 32-bit or 64-bit address spaces respectively
+ RV32E -> has been added to support small microcontrollers, and which has half the number of integer registers

ATTENTION -> RV32I is NOT a subset of RV64I
