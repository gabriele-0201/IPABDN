\begin{Abstract}
How can a distributed network agree on the execution of an arbitrary code in a trust-free way? Currently there are plenty of solutions to achieve that. Every solution differs by the network's structure and protocols but the common ground is the presence of a bytecode that is able to run arbitrary code in a deterministic manner. This paper will describe the basic characteristics of a Platform Agnostic Bytecode and how is used in Polkadot, a distributed network that `aims to provide a scalable and interoperable framework for multiple chains with pooled security`(polkadot-overview paper).
