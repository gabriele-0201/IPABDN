\section{WASM Rivals}

WASM is not the only PAB used in the blockchain space, other technologies use different solutions involving different protocols and algorithms but more important the different PABs. Examples are Ethereum with the custom PAB executed by the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) or Solana that decided to used eBPF to implement the SmartConctract feature.

\subsection{EVM}

Ethereum

Ethereum Virtual Machine is one of the first

Explain what is EVM Bytecode and how is used in Ethereum

\subsection{eBPF}

Explanation over eBPF, how Solana is using it and then how and why is not a good fit for polkadot (https://forum.polkadot.network/t/ebpf-contracts-hackathon/1084)

\subsection{RISC-V}

What is RISC-V, why seems to be a good fit for polkadot (https://forum.polkadot.network/t/exploring-alternatives-to-wasm-for-smart-contracts/2434)
