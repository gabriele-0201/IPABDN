We have seen how PABs are important for a decentralized network, in particular for blockchains. Wasm is the main PAB used in Polkadot but other blockchains are using different solutions because wasm was not invented for this specific purpose and it has some problems and some behavior that needs to be adapted to a decentralized network.

Inventing something from scratch could satisfy every needs of a blockchain but with the cons of creating and managing an entire bytecode only for this nice.

The best approach seems to be something along RISC-V, an Open Standard that can be suitable for multiple environments while also being adaptable and composable. Those characteristics offer the possibilities of modeling the bytecode to almost satisfy every niche and exploit every tool or contribution by other environments that are relying on the same technology.
