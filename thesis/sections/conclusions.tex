We have seen how PABs are important for a decentralized network, in particular for blockchains. Wasm is the main PAB used in Polkadot but other blockchains are using different solutions, each of which has its own pros and cons.  Wasm was not invented for this specific purpose and it has some problems and some behaviors so that some adaptation is required to make it fit for decentralized networks.

Inventing something from scratch could satisfy every requirement of a blockchain, but with the cons of creating and managing an entire technolopgy only for this niche.

The best approach seems to be something along RISC-V, an Open Standard that can be suitable for multiple environments while also being adaptable and composable. Those characteristics offer the possibilities of modeling the bytecode to  satisfy almost every niche requirement, while allowing to exploit every tool or contribution by other environments that are relying on the same technology.
