\title{The Importance of a Plaform-Agnosting Bytecode for a Decentralized Network}

\begin{abstract}

How can a distributed network agree on the execution of an arbitrary code in an trust-free way? Currently there is plenty of solution to achieve that, every solution differs by the network's structure and procols but the common ground is the presence of a bytecode that is able to run arbitrary code in a deterministic manner. The following 'paper' will describe the basic characteristics of an Platform Agnostic Bytecode and how is used in Polkadot, a distribuited network that `aims to provide a scalable and interoperable framework for multiple chains with pooled security`(polkadot-overview paper).
