* Plan
1. [x] Diagonal read whitepaper
2. [x] Diagonal read polkadot overview
3. [x] Extract WHERE an agnostic platform bytecode is important
4. [\] Read about current agnostic bytecode (wasm, LLVM IR, solana eBPF, EVM, ...)
5. [x] Start write down more or less proper structure
6. [x] Understand if the thesis should be on polkadot or on an agnostic bytecode
7. [x] End of the weekend -> decide if continue or NOPE -> make an abstract -> write to BOLDRING
8. [x] Wait for a response
9. [ ] Study and take notes on (cross when I think I have a proper understand to summarize stuff... is ok to leave some stuff behind):
   1. [x] WASM
      -> cover almost everything... maybe worth to go in wasmtime / wasmi implementation
   2. [ ] Polkadot
      1. [ ] Parachian registration -> PVF registration
      2. [ ] parablock -> PoV
      3. [ ] Runtime in polkadot node
      4. [ ] Runtime managment in Substrate / Cumulus
      5. [ ] Host functions
      6. [ ] Runtime API
      7. [ ] Cryptography in runtime
   3. [ ] Rivals
      1. [ ] EVM
      2. [ ] Sonala eBPF
      3. [ ] CosmosWASM
      4. [ ] RISC - V
10. [ ] start write down stuff
11. [ ] let's see how stuff goes and where I can put more or less focus!
