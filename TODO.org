* Plan
1. [x] Diagonal read whitepaper
2. [x] Diagonal read polkadot overview
3. [x] Extract WHERE an agnostic platform bytecode is important
4. [\] Read about current agnostic bytecode (wasm, LLVM IR, solana eBPF, EVM, ...)
5. [x] Start write down more or less proper structure
6. [x] Understand if the thesis should be on polkadot or on an agnostic bytecode
7. [x] End of the weekend -> decide if continue or NOPE -> make an abstract -> write to BOLDRING
8. [x] Wait for a response
9. [ ] Study and take notes on (cross when I think I have a proper understand to summarize stuff... is ok to leave some stuff behind):
   1. [x] WASM
      -> cover almost everything... maybe worth to go in wasmtime / wasmi implementation
   2. [x] Polkadot
      1. [x] Parachian registration -> PVF registration
      2. [x] parablock -> PoV
      3. [x] Runtime in polkadot node       |-> very related
      4. [x] Runtime managment in Substrate |
      5. [x] Cumulus
         1. [x] PoV
         2. [x] PVF
      6. [x] Host functions
      7. [x] Runtime API
      8. [x] Cryptography in runtime
   3. [\] Rivals -> Could be done better BUT I don't know how much I will go deep in this topic
      1. [\] EVM
      2. [\] Sonala eBPF
      3. [\] CosmosWASM
      4. [\] RISC - V
10. [x] How the runtime is entered when a block needs to be validate and authored?
11. [ ] start write down stuff
12. [ ] let's see how stuff goes and where I can put more or less focus!
