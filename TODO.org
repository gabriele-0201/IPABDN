* Plan
1. [x] Diagonal read whitepaper
2. [x] Diagonal read polkadot overview
3. [x] Extract WHERE an agnostic platform bytecode is important
4. [\] Read about current agnostic bytecode (wasm, LLVM IR, solana eBPF, EVM, ...)
5. [x] Start write down more or less proper structure
6. [x] Understand if the thesis should be on polkadot or on an agnostic bytecode
7. [x] End of the weekend -> decide if continue or NOPE -> make an abstract -> write to BOLDRING
8. [x] Wait for a response
9. [ ] Reading -> taking notes
10. [ ] Colletting every kind of usefull stuff to read
11. [ ] When I think I read enough to have a general knowledge -> decide more precisely which topics I should explain (so go deeper) in the thesis:
    1. [ ] WASM
    2. [ ] Polkadot
    3. [ ] Usage of WASM in polkadot -> cryptography and everything else
    4. [ ] Rivals
       1. [ ] RISC - V
12. [ ] start write down stuff
13. [ ] let's see how stuff goes and where I can put more or less focus!
